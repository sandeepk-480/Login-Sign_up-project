Have used Django inbuilt form for creating login/signup page.<br> 
Have done  proper validations, Authentication and Authorization.<br>
Without logging dashboard can't be visited by anonymous user.<br>
Once the user login he/she will be redirected to dashboard.<br>
If user is authenticated he cant revisit login page until he/she logout. <br>
Uploading profile picture is not required. so have given a default image for the given users.<br>
